        <p>I went to paris.The food there was really good and I ate regular french fries with ketchup and then the next day I went out to try spaggetti and meatballs and it was <strong>immacoulous</strong>.I went to visit the Effeil Tower which was humongous and very tall.I went into the elevator and looked throuigh the elevator and were so <strong>high up</strong>.Le 58 Tour Effiel was a good resteraunt in my opinion.So <strong>this trip was a blast!</strong></p>

        <p id="river">I went to the Amazon River and boy oh boy it was so big and there was lots of units of water just gushing and gushing from basins.I heard it was the largest river and believe me,it is!This trip consisted of alot of travelling on a boat throught the Amazon River and It was at times difficult to Paddle up but it all worked out and was totally worth it.It was an Exotic Trip!</p>
